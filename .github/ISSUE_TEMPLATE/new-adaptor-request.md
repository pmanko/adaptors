## Request
_What is the new adaptor you want to build? And at a high-level, what should this adaptor do?_

_Example Text:_
```
We want to build a basic adaptor to integrate with the REST API for `App X`, which does [add add description]. 
 
To start, this adaptor should: 
1. handle authentication 
2. include a generic GET helper so we can get any resource
3. include a generic POST so we can create any resource
4. include a generic PUT so we can update any resource

_Later_ we can consider adding more abstraction and specific helper functions. For now, the generic requests would be a great start. (FYI I think Hunter recently worked on a template for these generic http requests when she was working on Satusehat adaptor with Joe - maybe sync with her if you're not sure what next steps are.)
```

## Credentials 
- **Login credentials:** _Provide login credentials to a demo/test/sandbox environment._
- **Test record(s):** _Add links or descriptions on how to access test data._
- **Authentication method(s):** _Note if this adaptor should handle specific API protocols (e.g., Oauth, API Key), ensure the right access is configured, 
and provide links to relevant app/API documentation._


_Example Text:_
```
See LP `CHT Demo Project` for login information for authentication via Basic Auth.
You'll find that there is already some dummy data for `contacts` in the systems to query.
```

## Resources
_Add links to API docs and any other app docs that might be useful_

### Logo Links
_Add links to where to find the app's logo for the adaptor logo_
